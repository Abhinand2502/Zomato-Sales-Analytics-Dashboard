## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing restaurant order data to extract meaningful business insights. The dashboard provides a structured view of sales performance, customer behavior, and location-based trends using dynamic Excel features.

The objective is to transform raw transactional data into an interactive and insight-driven analytical report.
